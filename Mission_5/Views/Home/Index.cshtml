            <div class="col-md-6 text-md-start">
                <p>When I was younger, I was a very active kid. This included playing outside with my friends, running cross country, and playing baseball.
                    In order to not be as small and to be able to play the sports that I love, I started to go to the gym when I was 16. It was often infrequent and with little to no knowledge of how
                    each workout would work different muscle groups. When I got to school after my mission, I wanted to make working out a part of my routine and the rest is history... </p>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-6 text-md-start">
                <p><b>Push Day</b> focuses on training the upper body muscles involved in pushing movements, primarily targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
                    Exercises such as bench presses, shoulder presses, dips, and triceps extensions are commonly included to build strength and muscle mass.
                    Since these muscles work together during pushing motions, structuring a workout around them ensures balanced development and efficiency.
                    Proper warm-ups and progressive overload are key to maximizing gains while minimizing injury risk.</p>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-6 text-md-start">
                <p><b>Pull Day</b> is dedicated to exercises that engage the muscles responsible for pulling movements, including the back, biceps, and rear deltoids.
                    Workouts typically incorporate pull-ups, rows, deadlifts, and bicep curls to strengthen these areas and improve posture. Because the back consists of
                    multiple large muscle groups, using a mix of compound and isolation exercises ensures well-rounded development. A strong back and biceps not only enhance
                    overall aesthetics but also provide essential support for other compound lifts and daily activities.</p>

        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-6 text-md-start">
                <p><b>Leg Day</b> targets the lower body muscles, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Squats, lunges, leg presses, and Romanian deadlifts
                    are fundamental exercises that promote strength, power, and endurance. Since the legs are responsible for generating force in most athletic movements,
                    training them effectively enhances overall performance. Many lifters consider leg day the most challenging due to the intensity required, but it’s crucial
                    for achieving a balanced and functional physique. Proper recovery and stretching are essential to avoid soreness and maintain mobility.</p>
